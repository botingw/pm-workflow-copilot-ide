# MVP Scope Document

## Overview
This document defines the scope of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a task management app aimed at small teams. The goal is to validate the core value proposition: simplifying task tracking and collaboration.

## Must-Have Features
- **Task Creation**: Users can add tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates.
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members with basic notifications.
- **Task Status Tracking**: Mark tasks as "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done."

## Success Metrics
- **User Adoption**: At least 10 teams sign up within the first month.
- **Task Completion Rate**: 80% of created tasks are marked "Done" within a week.
- **User Feedback**: Positive feedback from 70% of test users on ease of use.

## Exclusions (Out of Scope for MVP)
- Advanced reporting or analytics.
- Integration with third-party tools (e.g., Slack, Google Calendar).
- Mobile app (focus on web only for now).

## Next Steps
- Create low-fidelity wireframes for user testing.
- Conduct usability testing with 5-10 small teams.
