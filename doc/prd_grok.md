# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Product Management Workflow Assistant

## 1. Introduction
The **Product Management Workflow Assistant** is an AI-powered extension for coding IDEs such as Cursor and Cline. It streamlines the product management process by providing step-by-step guidance, automating documentation, and ensuring alignment with best practices. Integrated directly into the development environment, it makes product management accessible and efficient for users ranging from startup founders to experienced product managers. The MVP (Phase 1) validates core functionality for non-experts, focusing on Strategic Alignment and Problem Discovery, laying the foundation for a comprehensive assistant that supports all product management phases.

### Why It’s Needed
Product management can be complex and inaccessible, especially for non-experts like developers or entrepreneurs who lack formal training. Existing tools often operate outside development workflows, creating friction. This assistant bridges that gap by embedding AI-driven support within IDEs, reducing the learning curve and enhancing productivity.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### Core Features
- **Conversational Interface**: A chatbox within the IDE for natural language interaction, allowing users to input ideas or pain points (e.g., “I want an app to track habits”) and receive plain-language guidance (e.g., “Let’s define the mission and target users.”).
- **Workflow Guidance**: Step-by-step prompts and suggestions based on the first two phases of the product management workflow defined in `docs/product_management_workflow_startup.md`:  
  1. **Strategic Alignment**: Guides users to create a Product Charter, asking questions like “Who is this for, and what’s the main goal?” Offers lean options (e.g., “Would you like a one-page Product Charter?”).
  2. **Problem Discovery**: Suggests lightweight research methods (e.g., survey questions, summarizing online pain points) and helps create an Opportunity Brief.
- **Document Generation and Management**: Automatically creates the following documents for the MVP, using predefined templates and user inputs:
  - **Product Charter**: Mission, vision, North Star metric, target users, operating principles.
  - **Opportunity Brief**: Problem statement, personas, value proposition, market opportunity, risks.
- **Context Awareness**: Reads specific files (e.g., `product_charter.md`) to provide tailored suggestions based on prior inputs and tracks progress in `docs/pm-progress.json`.

### IDE Integration
- **File Interaction**: Creates and edits files (e.g., `product_charter.md`, `opportunity_brief.md`) in the `docs/` folder, with manual user saving.
- **Chat Integration**: Uses the IDE’s chatbox for user queries and commands, responding to basic file queries (e.g., “Summarize @OpportunityBrief.md”).
- **Progress Tracking**: Updates `docs/pm-progress.json` to record completed steps and generated files.

### Deferred Features (Post-MVP)
- **Custom Rules**: Allowing users to define quality standards (e.g., “Every feature must have a success metric”).
- **Collaboration Support**: Real-time feedback and alignment checks (e.g., “Does the MVP scope match the Opportunity Brief?”).
- **Versioning**: Automatic version control for documents.
- **Advanced File Referencing**: Previewing changes before saving or querying multiple files.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements outline the essential qualities the system should have to meet user needs. At this stage, we focus on general characteristics to allow flexibility for later refinement.

- **Performance**: The system should respond quickly to user interactions, enabling efficient workflows without noticeable delays.
- **Security**: The system must safeguard user data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity throughout its operation.
- **Usability**: The interface should be straightforward and intuitive, allowing users to navigate and complete tasks with minimal effort.
- **Reliability**: The system should function consistently, avoiding frequent interruptions or failures during use.
- **Scalability**: The system should support growth in users and data, maintaining performance as demand increases.

## 6. Success Metrics
Success metrics are divided into **MVP Metrics** (for validating Phase 1 functionality) and **Vision Metrics** (to track progress toward the full product’s goals). This ensures the MVP delivers immediate value while aligning with the broader objectives of simplifying product management, enhancing efficiency, and fostering collaboration.

- **MVP Metrics (Phase 1: Strategic Alignment and Problem Discovery)**:
  - **Completion Rate**: Percentage of users who successfully complete the Product Charter and Opportunity Brief using the assistant (Target: >70% of test users).
  - **Usability Feedback**: Qualitative user feedback on the ease of use and clarity of guidance in the conversational interface (Target: >80% positive sentiment in surveys or interviews).
  - **Task Efficiency**: Time taken to generate key documents (e.g., Product Charter, Opportunity Brief) compared to manual processes (Target: 50% time reduction for non-expert users).

- **Vision Metrics (Full Product, Tracked Post-MVP)**:
  - **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score (NPS) or user satisfaction rating across all personas (startup founders, developers, PMs) for the end-to-end workflow (Target: NPS > 50).
  - **Efficiency**: Reduction in time spent on product management tasks across all phases (Target: 30% reduction compared to traditional tools like Jira or Notion).
  - **Quality**: Percentage of generated documents (e.g., PRD) requiring minimal revisions (Target: <20% need significant rework).
  - **Adoption**: Number of active users or projects using the assistant in Cursor (Target: 500+ active users within 6 months post-full release).
  - **Collaboration**: Percentage of users reporting improved team alignment (e.g., via surveys during PRD review) (Target: >75% report positive impact).

- **Measurement Approach**:
  - For MVP: Collect data via user testing sessions (e.g., 10-20 non-expert users), tracking completion rates and gathering feedback through brief surveys.
  - For Vision: Plan for post-MVP analytics (e.g., in-IDE usage tracking, user surveys) to monitor progress toward full product goals, starting in Phase 3.

## 7. Development Phases
Each phase’s success metrics align with MVP goals while contributing to vision metrics, ensuring incremental progress toward the full product.
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Core functionality for Strategic Alignment and Problem Discovery, generating Product Charter and Opportunity Brief with basic IDE integration.
- **Phase 2**: Expands to Solution Definition and Feasibility Checks, adding support for MVP Scope Document, Usability Findings, Technical Feasibility Note, and Business Viability Sketch.
- **Phase 3**: Full workflow support (Requirements Finalization), plus advanced features like custom rules, collaboration tools, and versioning.

## 8. Competitive Landscape
Existing tools like Jira or Notion lack AI-driven guidance and IDE integration. General AI chatbots offer flexibility but no specialized product management workflow. This assistant’s unique value lies in its seamless integration with coding environments and tailored support for product management tasks.

## 9. Security and Privacy
- Data is processed securely, prioritizing local computation where feasible.  
- Cloud-based AI processing uses encrypted channels and complies with GDPR.  
- No data is stored or shared without explicit user consent.

## 10. Document Templates
The assistant generates documents using standardized structures, with lean options for the MVP to align with the flexibility principles in `docs/product_management_workflow_startup.md`:  
- **Product Charter**: Mission, Vision, North Star Metric, Target Users, Principles (MVP: Option for one-page version).  
- **Opportunity Brief**: Problem, Personas, Value Proposition, Market Opportunity, Risks (MVP: Option for one-page version).  
- **MVP Scope Document**: Features, Success Metrics, Exclusions (Post-MVP).  
- **PRD**: Introduction, Goals, User Stories, UX Specs, Metrics (Post-MVP).
