E-learning and online education platforms are becoming increasingly common. Developing an e-learning platform can be a complex but worthwhile project.

The development process involves creating a user interface, user profiles, data storage, content management, and course management.

The user management skills you learned in more basic projects are elevated with the content and course management concepts, so these projects are best suited for intermediate developers.
