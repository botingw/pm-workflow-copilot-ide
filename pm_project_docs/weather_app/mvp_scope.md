# MVP Scope: Weather App for Hikers and Campers

## Introduction
This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope for the Weather App, focusing on core features to provide essential value to hikers and campers. The MVP aims to validate key assumptions and gather early user feedback.

## Core Features (from Product Charter)
1.  **Trail-Specific Forecasts**: Weather predictions tailored to specific trail coordinates.
2.  **Safety Alerts**: Push notifications for sudden weather changes at campsite or trail locations.

## User Stories

### Trail-Specific Forecasts
*   **As a hiker**, I want to **search for a specific trail or campsite**, so that I can **get a weather forecast tailored to that location**.
*   **As a camper**, I want to **see a map view with my current location and weather overlay**, so that I can **quickly understand the weather conditions around me**.
*   **As an outdoor enthusiast**, I want to **toggle between different weather layers (precipitation, wind, temperature)**, so that I can **visualize various weather aspects relevant to my activity**.

### Safety Alerts
*   **As a hiker**, I want to **configure notification preferences (e.g., wind speed threshold)**, so that I can **receive alerts for specific weather conditions that might impact my safety**.
*   **As a camper**, I want to **receive push notifications for sudden weather changes at my selected campsite or trail locations**, so that I can **be aware of potential dangers and take necessary precautions**.

## Success Metrics for MVP
*   **User Engagement**: Daily active users, session length.
*   **User Satisfaction**: Ratings and feedback on core forecasting and alert features.
*   **Alert Effectiveness**: Percentage of users who receive and act on safety alerts.

## Exclusions for MVP
The following features are explicitly excluded from the MVP to maintain focus and expedite launch:
*   **Gear Assistant**: Recommendations for gear based on weather forecasts and activity type (as outlined in Product Charter). This will be considered for future iterations.
*   **Logging Past Trips**: Ability to log past trips and view historical weather data.
*   **Detailed Forecast for Specific Trail Segments**: While trail-specific forecasts are included, granular segment-by-segment forecasts are out of scope for the MVP.
*   **Advanced Customization**: Highly detailed or complex notification preferences beyond basic thresholds.

## Future Considerations
*   Integration of the Gear Assistant feature.
*   Expansion of historical data and trip logging.
*   Enhanced social sharing capabilities.

This MVP scope provides a clear roadmap for the initial development phase, ensuring a focused approach to delivering core value to our target users.
