# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Weather App for Hikers and Campers MVP

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Mission Statement
Empower hikers and campers with hyper-relevant weather insights to ensure safer, more enjoyable outdoor experiences.

### 1.2. Target Audience
*   **Primary**: Hikers and campers
*   **Secondary**: Outdoor enthusiasts who need precise weather information for their activities

### 1.3. Problem Solved
*   Lack of hyper-local, trail-specific weather information.
*   Difficulty in preparing for sudden weather changes in remote areas.
*   Uncertainty about appropriate gear for specific weather conditions.

### 1.4. Key Objectives
*   Provide accurate, location-specific weather forecasts
*   Enhance user safety through timely weather alerts
*   Offer personalized gear recommendations based on weather conditions (Note: Gear recommendations are excluded from MVP, but this is a long-term objective)

## 2. MVP Scope

### 2.1. Core Features (MVP)
1.  **Trail-Specific Forecasts**: Weather predictions tailored to specific trail coordinates.
2.  **Safety Alerts**: Push notifications for sudden weather changes at campsite or trail locations.

### 2.2. Exclusions for MVP
The following features are explicitly excluded from the MVP to maintain focus and expedite launch:
*   **Gear Assistant**: Recommendations for gear based on weather forecasts and activity type.
*   **Logging Past Trips**: Ability to log past trips and view historical weather data.
*   **Detailed Forecast for Specific Trail Segments**: While trail-specific forecasts are included, granular segment-by-segment forecasts are out of scope for the MVP.
*   **Advanced Customization**: Highly detailed or complex notification preferences beyond basic thresholds.

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1. Trail-Specific Forecasts
*   **As a hiker**, I want to **search for a specific trail or campsite**, so that I can **get a weather forecast tailored to that location**.
*   **As a camper**, I want to **see a map view with my current location and weather overlay**, so that I can **quickly understand the weather conditions around me**.
*   **As an outdoor enthusiast**, I want to **toggle between different weather layers (precipitation, wind, temperature)**, so that I can **visualize various weather aspects relevant to my activity**.

### 3.2. Safety Alerts
*   **As a hiker**, I want to **configure notification preferences (e.g., wind speed threshold)**, so that I can **receive alerts for specific weather conditions that might impact my safety**.
*   **As a camper**, I want to **receive push notifications for sudden weather changes at my selected campsite or trail locations**, so that I can **be aware of potential dangers and take necessary precautions**.

## 4. User Flow (MVP)

### 4.1. Onboarding
1.  User opens app for the first time
2.  Prompted to select role: Hiker or Camper
3.  Requests location permissions for trail/campsite tracking

### 4.2. Dashboard
1.  Map view displays current location with weather overlay
2.  "Pack Smart" section (Note: Gear Assistant is excluded from MVP, so this section will be a placeholder or simplified in MVP)
3.  User can search for specific trails or campsites

### 4.3. Alert System
1.  User configures notification preferences (e.g., wind speed threshold)
2.  System sends push notifications for weather alerts at selected locations

### 4.4. Key Interactions
*   User can toggle between different weather layers (precipitation, wind, temperature)
*   User can view detailed forecast for specific trail segments (Note: Granular segment-by-segment forecasts are excluded from MVP, so this will be a simplified view for the overall trail/campsite)
*   User can log past trips and view historical weather data (Note: Excluded from MVP)

## 5. Wireframes (MVP Core Screens)

### 5.1. Onboarding Screen
*   Simple welcome screen with role selection (Hiker/Camper)
*   Option to enable location services

### 5.2. Dashboard Screen
*   Map view with weather overlay
*   "Pack Smart" section (simplified/placeholder for MVP)
*   Search bar for trails/campsites

### 5.3. Alert Configuration Screen
*   Customizable notification preferences
*   Threshold settings for weather alerts

## 6. Technical Feasibility

### 6.1. Key Technical Considerations
*   **Data Sources**: Access to reliable weather data APIs (evaluate costs, rate limits, accuracy).
*   **Location Services**: Integration with device GPS, geocoding/reverse geocoding.
*   **Map Integration**: Embedding interactive maps.
*   **Backend System**: Robust backend for monitoring and triggering alerts.
*   **Notification Service**: Integration with push notification services.
*   **Threshold Logic**: Implementing logic for "sudden weather changes".

### 6.2. Potential Risks
*   API reliability and uptime, cost of high-volume API calls.
*   Accuracy of hyper-local weather data in remote areas.
*   Battery consumption from location tracking.
*   Latency in data updates, reliability of push notification delivery.

### 6.3. Architecture Considerations
*   Mobile App Development: Cross-platform (React Native, Flutter) for faster MVP.
*   Backend: Cloud-based solutions (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
*   Database: Storing user preferences, saved locations.

## 7. Business Viability

### 7.1. Market Analysis
*   **Target Audience**: Niche but dedicated market (hikers and campers).
*   **Market Size**: Substantial and growing outdoor recreation market.
*   **Problem Solved**: Hyper-local weather, safety, gear uncertainty.

### 7.2. Value Proposition
*   **USP**: Hyper-relevant, location-specific weather insights and safety alerts.
*   **Benefits**: Enhanced safety, better preparation, more enjoyable outdoor experiences.

### 7.3. Revenue Streams (Potential)
